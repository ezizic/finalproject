# Final Project


In this project we have two interactive maps that highlight volcanoes, but we focus on volcanoes in different capacities. 


The first map is to examine clustering of all volcanoes. We decided it was important to know what risk level these volcanoes posed. This is useful to assess our individual vulnerability, especially if we live nearby a volcano.

The second map is to visualize historically significant volcanic eruptions in proximity to the fault line and significant earthquakes. The logic behind this map is that if one natural disaster, an earthquake, occurs then it could trigger a volcano to errupt. This is obvious when seeing the fault line's relation to both earthquake and volcanoes
